1x4 grid layout
1 event handler (click, place in button component)
Box handles typing
Line 2 has 2 components (label, text field) which doesn't work with grid, put both of them into a panel which you place in the grid
just grid.add(component) to put components in
When displaying line 4, just use the exact String taken in from text box for the first part (A 12 inch..., 12 is var)
Java doesn't have ** operator, use MATH.pow(size / 8, 2)
GUI siez is (350,300), can make a bit bigger if it's too small on your computer based on resolution
Don't need to handle if they put in a non-valid input, Java will throw an exception which we don't need to handle (prompt doesn't ask)
Button is easiest place to start
