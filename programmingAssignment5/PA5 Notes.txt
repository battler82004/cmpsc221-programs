Frame w/ title
Top section determines what to draw, panel lets them draw
Below tells mouse location on the panel
Combo box with shape options
2 colors, popup color picker window
Undo gets rid of last thing, clear removes everything
Nongradient just uses color 1
JSpinner to select line width and dash length (program only allows 1)
Use template zip, will only add code in 1 .java file (only touch Frame.java)
dashLength will be a float array of length 1
Want user to be able to see what they're drawing as it's being drawn (while holding, show)
Will have ArrayList of shapes, loop through each and call paint(), also allows easy deletion of one
Need to make 2 lines up top, JFrame w/ border layout, options panel in north, draw panel in center, status label in the south
	Tons of components in the top (use panels), 1 draw component in the center, 1 label component in south
	Lines 1 and 2 are normal panels w/ flow, put both in another panel (2 x 1 grid), make BG of panels 1  and 2 light blue color
Not required but can change background of color chooser to selected title
Only need event handler on buttons (for top), rest don't matter till we press the button
	*2 color choose, undo to remove last drawn
When add new objects, have to redraw everyrging
For DrawPanel, no panel for middle, specificy has private draw pmel  (????)
Lots of students add code for EventHandler, but forget to call it as an ActionListener in the outer constructor
mousePressed: need create stroke var, determine shape and color, create new My[Shape] and add to ArrayList
	In paintComponent, use for (MyShape shape : shapes) { shape.draw(g2d); }
To undo, remove shape from ArrayList and redraw: shapes.remove(shapes.size()-1);
For clear, use shapes.clear()
Define ArrayList inside the frame, that way easier to access
	Mouse released on drag: just change endpoint and repaint
	Mouse pressed just gives start point
		Point startPoint = new Point(event.getX(), event.getY());
Only thing in mouse moved is updating the status label
